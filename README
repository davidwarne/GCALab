Description:
------------
	GCALab is an analysis tool for the exploration of the dynamics of 
cellular automata defined on graphs.

Installation:
-------------
	Linux:
	- easy for linux users just run make
		$ make
    - Generate documentation (requires doxygen)
        $ make docs

    - If you are dynamically linking (the default in this project)
      you will need to add the libBitMap,libMesh and libGCA directorys to
      your LD_LIBRARY_PATH evironment variable. For example,
        $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/GCALab/libMesh:/path/to/GCALab/libGCA:/path/to/GCALab/libBitMap:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
      
      You can add these lines to your .bashrc or .bash_profile to avoid the 
      need to run this every time you login


	Windows:
	- c'mon, just install linux

A very special thanks to my wife, Sarah, for putting up with me during
this project, and listening to all my rants (or at least smiling and 
nodding).
